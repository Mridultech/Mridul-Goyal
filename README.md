# 👋 Hi, I'm Mridul  

### 🚀 Aspiring Data Scientist | Data Analysis • SQL • Python • Power BI

I am a learner actively working toward **Data Science roles**, with a strong foundation in  
**data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQL-based analysis**.

I enjoy working with **messy, real-world datasets** and converting raw data into  
**clear, actionable insights** that support decision-making.

I follow a **fundamentals-first approach** — mastering data understanding and analysis  
before going deep into advanced machine learning.
