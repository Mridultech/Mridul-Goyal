👋 Hi, I’m Mridul

Aspiring Data Scientist | Data Analysis • SQL • Python • Power BI

I am currently a learner working toward Data Science roles, with a strong focus on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQL-based analysis.
I enjoy working with messy, real-world datasets and converting raw data into clear, decision-oriented insights.

My approach is fundamentals-first: mastering data understanding, cleaning, and analysis before going deep into advanced modeling.

🧠 What I’m Currently Focused On

Strengthening data cleaning & EDA skills using Python

Solving business-style analytical problems using SQL

Building clear dashboards to communicate insights

Learning statistics for data analysis (currently at a basic level)

Gradually expanding into machine learning concepts

🛠️ Technical Skills

Data Analysis

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Insight Generation & Data Interpretation

Programming & Tools

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries)

Power BI (Interactive Dashboards, Data Modeling)

Excel (Analysis & Reporting)

Foundations

Basic Statistics for Data Analysis

Data Visualization & Storytelling

📂 Projects
📊 Sales Dashboard — Power BI

Built an interactive dashboard to analyze sales performance across categories and regions

Cleaned and transformed raw transactional data for accurate reporting

Enabled identification of top-performing products and trends

🧹 Data Cleaning Case Studies (Real-World Datasets)

Performed data quality assessment on messy datasets

Handled missing values, inconsistent categories, and incorrect data types

Prepared clean, analysis-ready datasets for downstream use

🛒 SQL E-commerce Case Study

Solved business questions using joins, aggregations, and subqueries

Analyzed customer behavior, order trends, and revenue patterns

Focused on writing clean and readable SQL queries

📉 Churn Prediction (Learning Project)

Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand churn drivers

Performed feature understanding and preprocessing

Built baseline machine learning models for learning purposes

⏳ Time Series Forecasting

Analyzed historical data to understand trends and seasonality

Applied basic forecasting techniques to predict future values

🧩 Customer Segmentation

Explored customer behavior patterns using data analysis techniques

Applied clustering concepts to group similar customers

📈 How I Work

I prefer hands-on learning through real data

I focus on clarity over complexity

I believe strong analysis is more valuable than blindly applying algorithms

I document my learning and improve projects iteratively

🌱 Current Learning Goals

Strengthen statistics for data science

Improve SQL depth (CTEs, performance concepts)

Build end-to-end data science projects

Work consistently with real-world, unclean datasets
